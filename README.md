# transit-rentals
This is an application intended to highlight affordable rentals for people who prefer Public Transit.

This project involved two parts - 
1. Finding the best rentals based on attributes from rental listings like Zillow.
2. Using the Google API to find the optimal rental place.

Right now, I am awaiting API access from Zillow. I have an implementation for the optimal rental place based on three different metrics
- average distance, weighted average distance and K-nearest neighbors.
